# Three Partition

You have a very simple task: just partition a series of numbers into three parts and make their sum is the same.

More formally, you will first get a positive integer N indicating that there will be totally N numbers as follow. And then you will get N positive integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ⋯, $a_n$, you should calculate whether there is a three - partition that can partition them into three parts and their sum is exactly the same, if the answer is yes, you also need to output the 3 parts in 3 lines.

> **bonus**: If partition these numbers into 4,5,⋯,k(k is a given number but not a input) parts, do you r above different types of algorithm also work? If not work, can you try some new type of algorithm to solve it? If work, Can you analyze the time complexity of them?

cd to `code/` use cmake to compile the project
or you can cd to `code/test/` to run the test scripts
If you just run the scripts, you can use `-f` to redirect the input and the output to `testcase/` for debug
